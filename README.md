Synopsis
========

```lua
local shdict_simple = require "resty.shdict.simple"

local function dlog(ctx, ...)
    ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG, "my app: ", ...)
end

local function error_log(ctx, ...)
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "my app: ", ...)
end

local pos_ttl = 20000  -- in ms
local neg_ttl = 10000  -- in ms

local my_shdict_set, my_shdict_get
                  = shdict_simple.gen_shdict_methods{
                       debug_logger = dlog,
                       error_logger = error_log,
                       positive_ttl = pos_ttl,
                       negative_ttl = neg_ttl,
                    }

-- on hot code paths:

local ctx = ngx.ctx

local key = "name"
local value = "John Green"

-- when value == "", negative ttl is used; otherwise positive ttl is used.
my_shdict_set(ctx, key, value)

-- it is also possible to override the default ttl for a single method call:
my_shdict_set(ctx, key, value, my_temp_ttl)

local res, stale = my_shdict_get(ctx, key)
if not res then
    if stale then
        -- use the stale data in the cache...
    end
end
```

TODO
====

* Add a test suite under `t/`.
